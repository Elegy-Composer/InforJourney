▲ Spirit of Forest (森之靈)

A Telegram bot for a game called "災厄之旅途".

It was originally created during INFOR 31st Hackathon.

## Game Play
Use `/join` command to join the game (max 4 players), even during the game!  
Until all players have joined, use `/start` to start the game.  

Use `/jizz` command to roll your die (1 ~ 4), and you would meet a monster or find a treasure box.  
Also, you could buy things (weapons/armors/potion) in shop or upgrade equipments in smithy.  

If you feel tired, you are able to leave at any time with `/retire` command twice.  

Try your best to defeat the final boss and clear the game!
